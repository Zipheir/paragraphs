# paragraphs

This is a paragraph-filling tool for Unicode text. It is intended
to have an interface similar to that of `fmt(1)`. The algorithm is
a functional, much-simplified version of the one described by
Donald Knuth and Michael Plass in "Breaking Paragraphs into Lines".

Everything is quite rough at the moment.

Currently, the implementation uses CHICKEN Scheme, but I intend to
make it more portable once development settles down.
